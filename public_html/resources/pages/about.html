            <p>CompRes version 2 (for short CompRes 2) was designed, coded and implemented by <b>David Enrique Sanchez Oliva</b> at Newcastle
                University, UK, 2022-2024 as part of the Thesis:
            </p>
                
            <p>
                <b>An Analysis Framework for the Resilience of Cyber-Physical Urban Transport Networks:</b> <i>A Theoretical Approach to Studying the 
                    Resilience of UTNs and Similar Complex Systems Using Concepts of Computer Networks and Operating Systems.</i>
                </i>
            </p>    
                 

            <p>
                    The research superviser is Dr. Charles Morisset.
            </p>


            <p>An earlier version of this software, called 'CompRes' (retroactively called 'CompRes 1') was used for an article presented in PASM'22 
                (11th International Workshop on Practical Applications of Stochastic Modelling).
                This workshop is collocated with EPEW 2022 (18th European Performance Engineering Workshop).
                The research is supervised by Dr. Charles Morisset.
                To preserve the software that accompanied the article, 'CompRes 1' was code frozen
                and a new 'CompRes 2' code was branched.
            </p>

            <p>This prototype was created using Javascript, HTML and CSS. It was tested in Safari on macOS 14.5
                (Sonoma) on a MacBook. It was coded using Visual Studio Code.
